Idea : distance of points in the cluster from the centroid should be low for a good value of K

for each cluster let \bar{x} be the centroid and x_ij be the points of the cluster 
Y_j = sum of square of distances from centroid 

Algorithm : 
Perform clustering for k = 0 to n
Calculate the value of \sum{j in 1 to K} Y_j
return K for which the above sum is minimum 

Note: If you let your K increase to a value comparable to the szie size of the dataset then ultimately every point will end up becoming a centroid 
This is a bad idea
So the value of K after which the value of the sum calculated above does not change much should be choosen
