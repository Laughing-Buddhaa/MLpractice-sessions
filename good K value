Idea : distance of points in the cluster from the centroid should be low for a good value of K
for each cluster let \bar{x} be the centroid and x_ij be the points of the cluster 
Algorithm : Perform clustering for k = 0 to n
Calculate the value of \sum{j in 1 to K} Y_j
return K for which the above sum is does not decrease much i.e. K for which there is no drastic change in sum value
